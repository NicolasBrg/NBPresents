# NBPresents
Premium Mod for Forge 1.12.2, very easy to use server gift hunt creation with graphical interface and very advanced customization, compatible with Sponge permissions.

``Version 1.3.21.12``

## General
**NBPresents** allows you to create **collections** of present, a collection is made with minecraft decorative heads, which you can customize as you wish. Once created, your collection is displayed in a menu for your players to see how many presents they need to complete the collection. You can set display names, icons, commands to be executed after a player completes the collection and permissions. Each present in a collection can be collected by players with the required permission, and each present can also be renamed in the configuration. 

## Configuration
This category explains how to set up and use NBPresents. Please note that you need to have the "Gooeylibs" mod to guarantee security for the inventory menu. If you don't already have it, it will be provided to you.

### Permissions
Users must have OP permission for single player instances, for servers under Forges/Sponge, users will need the ``nbpresents.admin`` permission to configure the mod. No additional permissions are required for configuration.

### Licencing
Regarding the license, all players have access to the command ``/nbplicence`` which displays the information about the current license.

#### Buy a single license / network license
For purchases please go directly to my discord, where the prices are posted. To join, simply go here: https://discord.gg/w3S9ZQf8nR
Please note that single licenses will only work for a single server. For network licenses, the IP addresses of the authorized servers on the network must be sent to the developer to be linked to your license. 

#### Activate my license
*This process is the same for single licenses as for network licenses.*
The information used here is fictitious and will not work, it is used as an example.
For our example we will use this information:<br>
**Server/Network Name**: ``MyAmazingServer``<br>
**Server/Network Key**: ``AmazServQXCegs1X16``<br>

Then use these commands in order
``/nbplicence ServerName MyAmazingServer``<br>
``/nbplicence ServerKey AmazServQXCegs1X16``<br>
``/nbplicence Connect``<br>

A success message should then be displayed. If not, check your information and contact the developer if the license is still not activated. <br>
Once this is complete, use the command "**/nbplicence Ip**" and send the address to the developer to complete the process.
